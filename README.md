# Econometris: relationship between inflation and unemployment in japan

This is a group project whose goal was to study the relationship between inflation and 
unemplyment in japan using econometrics tools; mainly OLS.
We decided to test the relevance of two models:
1) Phillips Curve
2) New Kaynesian Phillips Curve --> This is the part I worked on (last 4 slides)

In this repository there are 3 files:
- Econometrics Japan Assignment.pdf --> contains the final report of the project
- japan_econometrics.R --> contains the R code used to study the model
