 #VALUE CREATION VS VALUE APPROPRIATION
 
 Although previous studies have analyzed not only the strategic and tactical trade-offs firms make, but also the effects of strategic emphasis on financial performance [1], we attempt to discover patterns with regards to the choice of strategic emphasis across firms in diverse business sectors and how managers should allocate their resources in various states of the market (i.e. growth, stagnation, recession). To capture the greatest degree of information in our results, we focus on firms in two business sectors with markedly different characteristics: Information Technology and Manufacturing, and attempt to provide both marketing and managerial insights to firms across the board by estimating and interpreting a carefully chosen model for the task.
