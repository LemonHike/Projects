This dataset is composed of 1000 samples with 21 features each. 
The first column is the sample id. The second column in the dataset represents the label. There
are 2 possible values for the labels. The remaining columns are numeric
features, except for the last column which is categorical (with 2 categories).

The task is: compare the performance of Logistic Regression  with that of
a Random Forest. Try to optimize both algorithms' parameters and determine which 
one is best for this dataset.
